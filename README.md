# Bye, House

A simple countdown app that calculates the exact time I should leave for work in the morning. 

Calculations are based on an inputted arrival time, as well as SFMTA data via Google Maps. The departure time can be offset by 5 minutes to accommodate stopping for coffee. 

Built to fulfill the final project requirement in General Assemblyâ€™s Front End Development course.
